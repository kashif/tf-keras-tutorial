    "At [Zalando Research](https://research.zalando.com/), as in most AI research departments, we realise the importance of experimenting and quickly prototyping ideas. With datasets getting bigger it thus becomes useful to know how to train deep learning models quickly and efficiently on the shared resources we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow's [Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/estimators) API is useful for training models in a distributed environment such as on nodes with multiple GPUs or on many nodes with GPUs. This is particularly useful when training on huge datasets. But we will first present the API for the tiny Fashion-MNIST dataset and then show a practical usecase in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TL;DR**: Essentially what we want to remember is that a `tf.keras.Model` can be trained with `tf.estimator` API by converting it to an `tf.estimator.Estimator` object via the `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` method. Once converted we can apply the machinery that `Estimator` provides to train on different hardware configurations."

    "* you can run Estimator-based models on a local host or an a distributed multi-GPU environment without changing your model;\n",

    "\n",
    "So how do we go about training our simple `tf.keras` model to use multi-GPUs? We can use the `tf.contrib.MirroredStrategy` paradigm which does in-graph replication with synchronous training. See this talk on [Distributed TensorFlow training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRMGoPqsn20) for more information about this strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially each worker GPU has a copy of the graph and gets a subset of the data on which it computes the local gradients and then waits for all the workers to finish in a synchronous manner. Then the workers communicate their local gradients to each other via a ring Allreduce operation which is typically optimized to reduce network bandwidth and increase through-put. Once all the gradients have arrived each worker averages them and updates its parameter and the next step begins. This is ideal in situations where you have multiple GPUs on a single node connected via some high-speed interconnect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this strategy we first create an Estimator from the compiled `tf.keras` model and give it the `MirroredStrategy` configuration via the `RunConfig` config. This configuration by default will use all the GPUs but you can also give it a `num_gpus` option to use a specific number of GPUs:"
